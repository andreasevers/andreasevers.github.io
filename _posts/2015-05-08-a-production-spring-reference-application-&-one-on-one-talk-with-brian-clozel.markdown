title: A Production Spring Reference Application & One on One talk with Brian Clozel
date: 2016-05-08 13:32:20 +0300
description: Sagan is the name of the Spring.io website. It’s built by Pivotal Labs and maintained and extended by Brian Clozel. The project uses a best-of-breed set of tools. In Brian Clozel’s talk he sheds a light on which tools are used for which reasons. After the talk I sit down with Brian to discuss some more details.
