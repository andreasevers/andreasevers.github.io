description: Releasing more often doesnâ€™t only allow new features reaching the user faster, it also fastens the feedback loops, improves reliability and availability, developer productivity and efficiency. Spinnaker plays a crucial part in all of this, as it allows more frequent and faster deployments, without sacrificing safety. Automated canary analysis, demonstrated in this codelab, is a powerful tool in that sense.
